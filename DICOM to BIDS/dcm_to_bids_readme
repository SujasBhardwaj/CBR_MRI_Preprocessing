This file loops through the subjects from the directory named incoming_dicoms and converts them to BIDS format. 
Once the conversion is completed, the subject folder is moved to another directory named "processed".
The final output is saved in a directory named "bids_output".
Requirements: installations: dcm2bids, dcm2niix.
Better to make a new environment!
Happy Coding!
